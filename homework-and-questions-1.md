    ```
    
13. What does <!DOCTYPE html> mean? What is its purpose and what kind of declaration is it?

14. What is the purpose and meaning of the html element? And which attribute does it usually contain?
	The HTML element represents the root/top-level element of an HTML document. All other elements on the page must be descendants of the HTML element. It usually contains the lang attribute.
    
15. What is the purpose and meaning of the head element?
	The main purpose of the HTML head element is to contain machine-readable information about the document(metadata). The head element primarily holds information for machine processing, not human readability. 

16. What is the general purpose and meaning of the meta element? And when it contains a charset attribute (what is the value of this charset attribute) ?
    The meta element is used to provide structured metadata. Metadata is not displayed on the web page but is machine parsable. The charset attribute is one of the attributes that the meta accepts and it specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.

20. What is Unicode?
	Unicode is an encoding system that solved the space issue of its predecessor ASCII. Unicode assigns a unique code, called a code point, to each character and is able to produce over a million code points.

21. Why can't Unicode be a standalone when it comes to encoding characters?
	Unicode can not store characters in binary, which computers need in order to the characters in text files.

22. What is UTF-8 and what does it do?
	UTF-8 is the encoding system for Unicode. It translates any Unicode character into a matching unique binary string and vice versa. 
    
23. Why is the UTF-8 encoding system unique?
	UTF-8 represents characters in one-byte units.

24. What are the advantages of UTF-8?
    - UTF-8 is spatially efficient, it converts code point into a set of 1-4 bytes, using less space for common characters and more space for less common ones.
    - UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII and is able to convert a text file formatted by ASCII to human-readable text.

25. What is the purpose and meaning ot the HTML title element?

30. What is the viewport? Why was it created? What element defines it? What attributes are used, and what do its attributes and corresponding values represent? Please also provide an example of the meta viewport tag.
	The viewport is the user's visible area of the web page. It was created when tablets and mobile phones were introduced in order to work dynamically with different screens. It is defined by the meta element. The attribute name=”viewport” is used in the meta element to give browsers instructions on how to control the page’s dimensions and scaling. The attribute content=”width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0” contains two values; width=device-width sets the width of the page to follow the screen width of a device and initial-scale=1.0 sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser. 
	```html
	Ex:<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
	```
